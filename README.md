2. Design Patterns:
  https://github.com/romeon0/MVC-Design-Patterns-Test/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/_Tests
  * Bridge Pattern (separate big classes into abstraction and implementation)
  * Publisher-Subscriber Pattern (Receive notifications when some value changed (asynchronous))
  * Observer Pattern (Receive notifications when some value changed(synchronous))
  * Chain of Responsability Pattern (Send requests along of a list o children. Each children will decide to process it or not)
  * Iterator Pattern (Traverse elements without exposing the collection type)
  * Memento Pattern
3. Unit Tests: 
  https://github.com/romeon0/MVC-Design-Patterns-Test/tree/main/Assets/UnitTests
 * Unity Test Runner
4. Other interesting stuff:
  * Definitions(DDD - Data Driven Design): https://github.com/romeon0/MVC-Design-Patterns-Test/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Definition
  * Factory Pattern(Create objects without knowing the type): https://github.com/romeon0/MVC-Design-Patterns-Test/tree/main/Assets/Scripts/Factory
  * Field Injector(Injection - set values for private fields): https://github.com/romeon0/MVC-Design-Patterns-Test/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Utils/FieldInjector.cs
